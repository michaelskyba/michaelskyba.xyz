<p> Just add: </p>

<code>
0.0.0.0 mysite
</code>

<p> to your /etc/hosts file. </p>

<p> Example: </p>

<code>
0.0.0.0 facebook.com
</code>
<p> Here, facebook.com will basically be an alias for '0.0.0.0' which acts as a dummy address. </p>

<p> This is a really simple thing that doesn't need an entire page of web bloat to explain... </p>
