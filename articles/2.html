		<h1>msk_music</h1>

		<p> I have decided to put this to use for sharing scripts I write, in
		hopes that one or two of them could be of use to somebody.</p>
		
		<h6><a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/2e04107265d4255671bb597581afd76a">msk_music</a></h2>
		
		<p>msk_music is a simple and featureless way of listening to music. It uses the
		equivalent of "random" and "consume" modes on mpd (which it aims to replace). For
		my use cases, which I believe are fairly standard, it does so successfully.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of having a vast number of configuration options, additional features
		can be implemented by changing the source code, which, due to being written in
		shell, is completely transparent. For instance,
		<a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/697a06b1f53f3f8a14e94bd9ccf4de3e">this
		patch</a> will have msk_music only run on .mp4 files.</p>
		
		<p>msk_music depends on mpv and a set of coreutils that support sed's "-i" flag.
		msk_music is around 20 LOC, and was written in about 10 minutes.</p>
