		<h1>Operating Systems</h1>

		<p>In this "article", I will write about several different operating
		systems that I have used. I am not an expert on any of them and there is
		a high chance that none of my rambling will be useful to anybody. I am
		mostly writing this "for fun" or "for myself", if that makes sense.</p>

		<h3>Desktop</h3>

		<h5><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10">Windows 10</a></h5>

		<p>When I first got my laptop, which is the computer I've used for most
		of my life, it came with Windows 10, which I used for a while. For the
		most part, I thought it worked fine. I didn't have anything to compare
		it to. Eventually, however, after repeatedly hearing about
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> and how it was
		supposedly "good for programmers", I decided to try it out.</p>

		<p>In hindsight, Windows 10 (and later Windows versions, I assume) is
		not very nice at all in relation to Linux (I'll be referring to the family
		of operating systems, not the kernel specifically, as "Linux"). Everyone
		has their own ideas about what makes a "good" operating system, but my
		personal issues are</p>

		<ul>

		<li>Configuration: Windows has very little room for low-level
		personalization, which is the opposite of Linux. The Linux kernel by
		itself is so minimal as to not even be an operating system, so all
		extensions of it are built from the ground up. You can choose any Linux
		distribution that you want, taking into account how much initial control
		you require and how much time you are willing to invest.</li>

		<li>Ecosystem: There is no end to the great software available for Linux
		that is incompatible with Windows - window managers, text editors,
		terminals, etc. Worst of all, Windows doesn't have an elegant way of
		piecing things together to automate tasks like Linux does (shell
		scripts).</li>

		<li>Performance: Windows 10 started out slower than any Linux distribution
		I've tried, and it seemed to get slower over time, unlike Linux. I think
		the initial problem is due to poor design and the performance tax of all
		the spyware that's running, and the degeneration is probably due to
		planned obsolescence in cooperation with hardware vendors.</li>

		<li>Malware: Because of Windows' popularity, most user-targeted malware
		is written for Windows, making you much more susceptible than you would
		be on Linux, on top of the included spyware. This point envelops any
		privacy concerns.</p>

		</ul>

		<p>I haven't spent very much time trying macOS, the other main operating
		system, but it seems to suffer from most of the same problems as
		Windows.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://lubuntu.me/">Lubuntu</a></h5>

		<p>When I first learned that there are multiple Linux distributions, I
		did not visit each distribution's website and read about their features.
		Instead, I read somewhere that

		<ol>
			<li>"Ubuntu is good for Linux beginners."</li>
			<li>There are multiple "flavours" of Ubuntu that I will have to
			choose from.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Using this information, and looking at some kind of list of Ubuntu
		flavours, I decided to go with Lubuntu, due to it supposedly using minimal
		system resources. I guess at this point I had already subconsciously
		internalized that bloated software was wrong, even if I didn't understand
		the details. In hindsight, an Ubuntu-like distribution is not going to
		be what you want to go with if your goal is minimalism.</p>

		<p>Lubuntu was easy to install when I followed its instructions. It was
		even enjoyable, considering how novel it was for me, who had never
		considered the concept of a non-Windows operating system running on my
		laptop.</p>

		<p>The only point at which I was annoyed was when it came to booting
		into Lubuntu after the successful installation. Instead of loading
		Lubuntu, I saw a message similar to this thumbnail from
		<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kuah6gYqT2I">this video</a>:</p>

		<img src="../assets/6-hp-message.jpg" alt="BootDevice Not Found">

		<p>Lubuntu's boot loader was installed as an EFI file and my computer
		wasn't loading it automatically. I didn't know this in advance. After
		spending literally over four hours trying many different things, I found
		an option in my boot menu that could load an arbitrary EFI file, where
		I found Lubuntu's entry listed. I had to take several naps in between
		troubleshooting sessions because I wasn't really used to banging my head
		against brick walls yet. I would much later go on to figure out how to
		automatically boot an EFI file while using Kiss Linux, but for now I had
		to go through the entire boot menu every time. None of this was
		Lubuntu's fault at all, though.</p>

		<p>After installation, I had fun looking at its LXQt GUI and fiddling
		with the many available screensavers. Ultimately, after having my
		desktop crash from switching a wallpaper and receiving an "idk" from the
		Linux Support Discord server I went to, I realized the importance of
		community. If nobody uses your operating system, nobody is going to be
		able to give you direct advice when something goes wrong. This is fine
		if you're capable of fixing most things yourself, but that was not the
		case for me at this point.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a></h5>

		<p>Instead, I switched to the main, official Ubuntu distribution, which
		I now understood was significantly more popular than Lubuntu. I never
		had any more crashes, and I used Ubuntu for a long time.</p>

		<p>I dislike Ubuntu for the same kinds of reasons a lot of people do.
		For beginners, I dislike their inclusion of diseases like
		<a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snap</a> and
		<a href="https://flatpak.org/">Flatpak</a>, which confuses the user on what
		way they should install software. Instead of trying to replicate their
		workflow on Windows, a distribution targetted at beginners should make
		it clear how Linux works and make it easy to adjust to it.</p>

		<p>In the context of me specifically, I dislike the enormous amount of
		software that it's shipped with, none of which I need or would ever
		want. I'm sure it's possible to remove all of it, but who would go
		through the pain of doing so when you can start with a blank slate
		instead? I'm sure some people would enjoy the supposed "challenge" but
		somebody like that would probably be annoyed with the fact that it would
		be difficult to brag about it. As soon as you say "I use Ubuntu", it's
		hard to paint the picture you want to paint with clarification.</p>

		<p>I also dislike their release and package model. On an operating
		system for servers, I understand why it might be important to ensure
		that everything running has been tested for long periods of time by
		users, but this is meaningless on a desktop operating system. "Rolling
		release" makes more sense for most people.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a></h5>

		<p>Arch Linux is the next distribution I tried and the one I now
		consider the best for my use cases. There are still things I dislike
		about it, though.</p>

		<p>Initially, I tried Arch as nothing more than a meme, hearing tales about
		it on the internet and wondering what was so funny about it. After using
		it for a while, my mindset shifted to something close to what it is
		now. The main things I like about Arch are the</p>

		<ul>

		<li>Minimalism: There is no window manager, desktop environment, display
		server, etc. installed, letting users install close to exactly what they
		want without compromises or headaches.</li>

		<li>Community: Arch has a huge user base. This means that there are many
		packages, many package updates, a sizable user repository, many solved
		problems on the forums, good documentation in the form of the
		<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/">Arch Wiki</a>, etc.</li>

		<li>Package release model: Packages in repositories are updated as soon
		as a maintainer has time to update them, so you are using the latest
		version of the software in most cases.</li>

		<li>(most importantly) Logo: <code>neofetch</code> looks cooler on Arch
		than it does on most other distributions.</li>

		</ul>

		<img src="../assets/6-arch-neofetch.png" alt="neofetch on Arch">

		<p>One thing I dislike is that despite how minimal it is, there are
		still things you are locked into, which is inevitable for any
		distribution. Mainly, on Kiss Linux, I enjoyed avoiding systemd and
		D-Bus, but I admit that at that point it's just a meme instead of
		anything remotely practical.</p>

		<p>Besides that, I dislike the general "i use arch btw" stereotype
		surrounding Arch Linux. Many people have the impression that Arch Linux
		is artificially difficult to install and use, saying that it's only for
		masochists. I completely disagree with this idea. In fact, I think Arch
		Linux is the easiest distribution to use. Installing it is easy too; I
		can do it in around ten minutes, although I can see why it can be
		confusing for somebody unfamiliar with Linux, which is why I
		(unfortunately) cannot recommend it to beginners.</p>

		<p>I dislike the message "i use arch btw" specifically because it
		implies "Arch is painful and difficult to use, but I'm so smart that I
		can do it anyway. Hahaha!" which only perpetuates the misinformation.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a></h5>

		<p>After using Arch for a while, I decided to try Gentoo for the same
		sort of reason I wanted to try Arch in the first place. Unlike Arch,
		Gentoo did not grow to become something I considered a particularly
		successful distribution.</p>

		<p>The first annoying thing was the installation, much more so than
		Arch's. This was furthered by the fact that I didn't yet understand what
		was going on with my BIOS, so I believed that my laptop would support
		both BIOS and UEFI, which wasn't true. I ended up failing a few
		installations but in the end, I got everything working, and the joy of
		seeing all the gcc output overpowered any frustration. It's fortunate
		that Gentoo provides a detailed, pretty high-quality installation guide
		in the form of the
		<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:Main_Page">Handbook</a>.

		<p>From the start, I was annoyed with the compilation. I don't have any
		high-end computer for cross-compilation so everything was done on my old
		hardware, which took ages. I didn't see and still don't see an
		overwhelming advantage of source packages over binary packages. I agree
		that</p>

		<ul>

		<li>Compiling things yourself, in accordance with your USE flags, gives
		you slightly better performance and slightly less "bloat".</li>

		<li>Source packages require less work than binary packages do for the
		package maintainers, so it's easier to have more packages with a smaller
		team size.</li>

		<li>Compiling source code yourself guarantees that you're only running
		what was written in the source code, which you can inspect, unlike a
		provided binary package from e.g. the Arch Linux repositories.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>but even together, these benefits don't come close to overcoming the
		inconvenience of compilation for me. I dislike that some people (mostly
		those who have never used Gentoo) overstate the inconvenience, however,
		spreading lies that you can't use your computer while compiling, or that
		it's somehow impossible to compile while you're away from the computer
		while e.g. sleeping.</p>

		<p>Besides the compilation, the shortage of community compared to Arch
		was felt strongly. Gentoo's packages were often out of date or
		dysfunctional, encouraging me to write my own packages, which at that
		point I had no interest in. The wiki was also much smaller in comparison
		to Arch's, which I continued to rely on but was only able to apply with
		some friction (since I wasn't on the distribution it was aimed at).</p>

		<p>I enjoyed using the
		<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Portage">Portage</a> package
		manager and the
		<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/OpenRC">OpenRC</a> init system,
		but in the end, I decided that Gentoo was a meme distribution and
		switched back to Arch.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://artixlinux.org/">Artix Linux</a></h5>

		<p>After getting even more familiar with Arch, I had the longing for
		falling for memes again and switched to Artix. With Gentoo, although I
		would still say that compilation is a meme, I think it's sort of
		arguable. However, it's not the case for the case against systemd. I
		don't think anyone can seriously say that their life is demonstrably
		affected by using e.g. runit instead of systemd. Of course, all else
		equal, I think it's reasonable to avoid systemd, but I don't believe
		that all else is equal on Artix.</p>

		<p>First off, internet is more of a hassle to get running on Artix than
		it is on Arch. There's no <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> by default,
		<code>rfkill</code> can be on by default, etc. which isn't a problem
		in the Arch ISO, where you can simply read <code>man iwctl</code> and
		have the pleasure of using
		<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd">iwd</a>.

		<p>By itself, this isn't much of a problem because it's relatively
		straightforward to figure out how to get the Wi-Fi working, but it
		<em>is</em> a big problem in the context of beginners. Unlike Arch,
		Artix can optionally be installed through a GUI, not unlike Ubuntu's
		installation. If this worked well, I would consider recommending Artix
		to beginners, but I cannot when Wi-Fi isn't easily configurable through
		a GUI. It could be possible that this was simply the fault of
		<a href="https://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a>, which is the only graphical
		installation that I've tested, but I doubt it.</p>

		<p>On top of that, I remember the experience of being annoyed with the
		init system packages not running their respective daemons, although my
		memory isn't strong enough for me to say anything for sure. I'll
		probably try Artix again sometime in the future.</p>

		<p>If Artix's init systems and packages worked predictably and if Artix
		had good documentation for parts of it that conflicted with the Arch
		Wiki, I would be happy to use it instead of Arch. The logo isn't as
		cool, but fine.</p>

		<p>If the developers make it effortless for people who have never used
		Linux to install, including Wi-Fi configuration, I would be very happy
		to recommend it to new users. However, only the installation, because I
		don't believe that the knowledge "gained" from installing Arch or Artix
		"manually" is particularly applicable to day-to-day usage. Trying to
		provide a GUI package manager, for example, would be a mistake, in my
		opinion.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://kisslinux.org/">Kiss Linux</a></h5>

		<p>Kiss Linux is the last meme distribution I tried before realizing
		that I was in denial about my prospects of "minimalism" and accepting
		Arch as The Answer.</p>

		<p>The installation was pretty simple, much more so than Gentoo's. The
		only problem I had was related to the kernel version I chose, but that
		was my fault: elsewhere on the website, the developers already had an
		explanation of the issue posted.</p>

		<p>The interaction with the system felt simple as well. The Kiss package
		manager makes sense and the package format is well-designed. Unlike Arch
		and Gentoo, where I would never consider reading the documentation about
		their package format and fiddling with my own package, I made many of my
		own Kiss packages. This is because there was almost no friction. You
		just put in the compilation instructions.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, there were problems that came up. First off, like
		Gentoo, packages are compiled and for the most part, binaries aren't
		distributed. I think there was one official binary repository that had
		a few browsers, but those were usually out of date, and I think they
		were demoted to "community" status around the time I switched back to
		Arch. This again brought in the inconvenience of waiting for things to
		compile, which was especially annoying when I needed to debug my build
		script. I might make a change, wait thirty minutes, see a compilation
		error, readjust, and so on, which wasn't fun.</p>

		<p>The community being small was also a concern, but only in the context
		of packages. Mainly, nobody had made a working qutebrowser package, and
		making it myself was extremely tiring. In the end, I had C-YAML or
		something like that missing which caused a ~10-second startup delay.
		This would never be a problem on something like Arch, even if it had
		source packages, because other, more experienced qutebrowser users would
		have already figured everything out ages ago.</p>

		<p>I say "only in the context of packages" because outside of that, the
		community was great. Specifically, I remember visiting the community IRC
		channel, where people were active, helpful, and friendly.</p>

		<p>Next, I dislike how the official repositories threw away
		<a href="https://www.x.org">Xorg</a> packages, switching completely to
		<a href="https://wayland.freedesktop.org">Wayland</a>. Because of the
		nature of the package system, this isn't a huge deal: which repositories
		are considered "official" doesn't really matter at all, but the result
		is that whatever Xorg repository you're using is going to fall into
		lower-quality maintenance. If something breaks, it would be mostly up to
		you to figure out, which seemed especially problematic for packages
		related to the display server.</p>

		<p>The straw that broke the camel's back was the fact that aiming to be
		extremely minimal requires sacrifices in usability, which comes with
		breakage when you don't know what you're doing. Even though I had
		already been using Linux for around a year at this point, I wasn't very
		familiar with any of the low-level systems, so every time something went
		wrong, it would take an enormous amount of time troubleshooting, reading
		documentation, and trying to implement a solution.</p>

		<p>In the end, I decided that I wasn't knowledgeable enough to use Kiss.
		When I had to spend so much time on each problem, it got in the way of
		actually using the computer. I couldn't imagine trying to use Kiss in a
		workplace environment, losing half my time fixing each of my mistakes.</p>

		<p>I haven't tried any other Linux distribution since I switched back to
		Arch but am open to trying more (or retrying earlier distributions) in
		the future.</p>

		<h3>Mobile</h3>

		<h5><a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/">iOS</a> and
		<a href="https://www.android.com/">Android</a></h5>

		<p>iOS, like Windows, was what I used for a while at first, my opinions
		on it stuck in a chamber. For the most part, using it felt fine, but
		around the time I switched to Arch for the last time, I started wanting
		an Android phone. After buying a
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_4a">Google Pixel 4a</a>
		(which was lucky; I didn't know that Pixels were especially open to
		flashing ROMs when I bought it), I've never had any desire to go
		back.</p>

		<p>The biggest problem is the lack of an ecosystem. There are many great
		apps for Android that don't exist on iOS and there are very few decent
		apps for iOS that don't exist on Android. From my limited understanding
		of the situation, the main causes are</p>

		<ul>

		<li>You need a Mac to develop iOS apps.</li>

		<li>You need to pay an annual membership of $99 USD to have your app on
		the Apple App Store. This makes it impossible for most non-profit apps
		to exist.</li>

		<li>Apple hardware is overpriced, making it difficult to use as a client
		for a community of software.</li>

		<li>Many Android devices make it easy to install custom ROMs.</li>

		<li>Android, for the most part, is open source, unlike iOS.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>Even disregarding the apps, Android feels better to use than iOS
		does. In my time using them, Android treated me like a real person while
		iOS regarded me as completely digitally illiterate.</p>

		<p>The only reason I went with an Apple phone initially was that I had
		this vague notion that Android was "cheap" or "low-quality". This isn't
		true at all. The only valid reason I see for using iOS is doing so as a
		twisted form of social signaling, but you have to consciously
		acknowledge that.</p>

		<h5><a href="https://calyxos.org/">CalyxOS</a>
		and <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">GrapheneOS</a></h5>

		<p>After learning about the possibility of installing custom ROMs, the
		first I tried was Calyx. At this point, I had been reading certain
		misinformation:

		<ul>

		<li>The main "privacy" ROMs are Calyx and Graphene.</li>
		<li>Graphene is more secure than Calyx but is significantly less usable.</li>
		<li>Calyx is a good balance between security and usability/convenience.</li>

		</ul>

		<p>The truth is that Graphene is <em>both more secure and more
		usable</em> than Calyx. Calyx is nothing but a worse copy of Graphene
		that fails to implement important features. From my experience and from
		the experience of others that I've talked to, Graphene's sandboxed
		Google Play works far better than Calyx's microG. There is no valid
		reason to use Calyx unless you consider ignorance morally acceptable
		in this context.</p>

		<p>The only other ROM I've heard of is
		<a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>. Lineage doesn't appeal
		to me because I don't see any definitive advantage of it. Its main trope
		seems to be that it's rooted, which might be important for some people,
		but I don't personally hold value to it. The great thing about Lineage,
		though, is that it supports far more devices than Graphene does, mainly
		because the Graphene developers don't want any of their models to be
		insecure.</p>

		<h3>Conclusion</h3>

		<p>That's all I have to say about my preferences/experiences with
		operating systems. How much do you disagree with? Is there anything that
		you <em>do</em> agree with? If you really hate me because of what I
		wrote in this article, feel free to bully me over email if that will
		make you feel better. Or, if you simply think I'm misinformed and have
		new information (e.g. "Artix uses iwd by default now. It's as easy as it
		is on Arch to connect to the internet!") then feel free to share that as
		well.</p>
