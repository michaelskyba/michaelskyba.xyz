		<h1>Block a site using /etc/hosts</h1>
		<p>Simply add <code>0.0.0.0 mysite</code> to your /etc/hosts
		file. Example: <code>0.0.0.0 facebook.com</code></p>
		
		<p>Here, facebook.com will basically be an alias for "0.0.0.0", which acts as a dummy address.</p>

		<p>Note that this isn't completely reliable. If it's not
		working, try adding a second entry with "www." and also try restarting
		your browser.</p>
