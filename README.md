I'm not sure what kind of README is expected for something like this.

## Credit
Credit to oxalorg for making [sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura),
which I use extensively here.

The SVG icons are from
[SuperTinyIcons](https://github.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons).

I also use [sup](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb/blob/master/sup) for
updating ``assets/rss.xml``.
