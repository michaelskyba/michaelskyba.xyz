I'm not sure what kind of README is expected for something like this.

## crss
crss is a script I made for updating the RSS feed. Using a Hugo template seems
like it would be annoying, since I have pages outside of Hugo that I would want
to be included. Also, I wanted to practice using Kakoune in filter mode.

## Credit
Credit to oxalorg for making [sakura.css](https://github.com/oxalorg/sakura),
which I use extensively here.

The SVG icons are from
[SuperTinyIcons](https://github.com/edent/SuperTinyIcons).
