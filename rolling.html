<p>While Arch and Gentoo have had internet working mostly
out-of-the-box, Artix has not. I thought it could be beneficial
if I compiled a list of steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Create /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with the following lines:
		<br>
		<code>
		ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
		<br>
		update_config=1
		</code>
	</li>
	<li> Make sure rfkill isn't messing things up: <code>sudo rfkill unblock wifi</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		Start wpa_supplicant: <code>sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>
		<br>
		My device name was 'wlan0', but you should edit the command if yours is different.
	</li>
	<li>
		Run wpa_cli (for me it didn't work without root):
		<br>
		<code>
		sudo wpa_cli
		<br>
		scan
		<br>
		scan_results
		<br>
		add_network
		<br>
		set_network 0 ssid "{the name of your wifi network}"
		<br>
		set_network 0 psk "{the password of your wifi network}"
		<br>
		enable_network 0
		<br>
		save_config
		<br>
		quit
		</code>
	</li>
	<li>Start dhcpcd: <code>sudo dhcpcd</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you should be done. I've done two Artix Installs and both of them have
succeeded with this procedure. Note that for both I have used the base-runit
installation, it's possible that using a different init system (openrc and s6
are available currently) will require different steps.</p>

On Arch and Arch-based distros, install the <a href="https://archlinux.org/packages/community/any/words/">words</a> package if you don't have it.

Here's a script I wrote for checking if you spelled a word correctly: <a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/5be53dbc7e1bc7b9a701893f8bee2d19">spell</a>
It depends on aspell, which needs the /usr/share/dict/words file. I understand that it's extremely ugly: I do not have any shell scripting experience.

<small>[<a href='#block-a-site-using-etchosts'>link</a>&mdash;<a href='blog/block-a-site-using-etchosts.html'>standalone</a>]</small>
<p>Just add:</p>

<code>
0.0.0.0 mysite
</code>

<p>to your /etc/hosts file.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<code>
0.0.0.0 facebook.com
</code>
<p>Here, facebook.com will basically be an alias for '0.0.0.0' which acts as a dummy address.</p>

<p>This is a really simple thing that doesn't need an entire page of web bloat to explain...</p>
