		<h1>Tools</h1>

		<p>These are some small JavaScript scripts.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><a href="tools/math.html">AsciiMath but with newlines</a></li>
			<p>AsciiMath is a really convenient alternative to LaTeX for most
			of my use cases, but its live demo doesn't support line breaks. This
			is an alternative UI which solves my issue.</p>

			<li><a href="tools/time.html">Unix / Epoch time conversions</a></li>
			<p>This lets you convert between Unix time and normal time. It would
			have been better as a CLI, but I felt like implementing it in JavaScript
			for some reason.</p>
