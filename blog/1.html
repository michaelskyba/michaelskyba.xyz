		<h1>Get a working Wi-Fi connection in an Artix Installation</h1>

		<p>While Arch and Gentoo have had internet working mostly
		out-of-the-box, Artix has not. I thought it could be beneficial
		if I compiled a list of steps:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Become root: <code>su</code></li>

			<li>
				Create /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with the following lines:
				<br>
<pre>
ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>Make sure rfkill isn't messing things up: <code>rfkill unblock wifi</code></li>

			<li>
				Start wpa_supplicant: <code>wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>
				<br>
				My device name was 'wlan0', but you should edit the command if yours is different.
			</li>

			<li>
				Run wpa_cli.
				<br>
<pre>
wpa_cli
scan
scan_results
add_network
set_network 0 ssid "{the name of your wifi network}"
set_network 0 psk "{the password of your wifi network}"
enable_network 0
save_config
quit
</pre>
			</li>

			<li>Start dhcpcd: <code>dhcpcd</code></li>
		</ol>

		<p>You should be done. I've done two Artix installs and both of them have
		succeeded with this procedure. Note that for both I have used the base-runit
		installation; it's possible that using a different init system (openrc and s6
		are available currently) will require different steps.</p>
