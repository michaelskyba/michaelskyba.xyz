<p>While Arch and Gentoo have had internet working mostly
out-of-the-box, Artix has not. I thought it could be beneficial
if I compiled a list of steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Create /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with the following lines:
		<br>
		<code>
		ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
		<br>
		update_config=1
		</code>
	</li>
	<li> Make sure rfkill isn't messing things up: <code>sudo rfkill unblock wifi</code>
	</li>
	<li>
		Start wpa_supplicant: <code>sudo wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>
		<br>
		My device name was 'wlan0', but you should edit the command if yours is different.
	</li>
	<li>
		Run wpa_cli (for me it didn't work without root):
		<br>
		<code>
		sudo wpa_cli
		<br>
		scan
		<br>
		scan_results
		<br>
		add_network
		<br>
		set_network 0 ssid "{the name of your wifi network}"
		<br>
		set_network 0 psk "{the password of your wifi network}"
		<br>
		enable_network 0
		<br>
		save_config
		<br>
		quit
		</code>
	</li>
	<li>Start dhcpcd: <code>sudo dhcpcd</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, you should be done. I've done two Artix Installs and both of them have
succeeded with this procedure. Note that for both I have used the base-runit
installation, it's possible that using a different init system (openrc and s6
are available currently) will require different steps.</p>
