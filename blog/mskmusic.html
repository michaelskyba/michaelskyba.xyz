<p> I have decided to put this "blog" to use for sharing scripts I write, in
hopes that one or two of them could be of use to somebody.</p>

<a style="font-size: 18px;" href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/2e04107265d4255671bb597581afd76a">msk_music</a>

<p>msk_music is a simple and featureless way of listening to music. It uses the
equivalent of "random" and "consume" modes on mpd (which it aims to replace). For
my use cases, which I believe are fairly standard, it does so successfully.</p>

<p>Instead of having a vast number of configuration options, additional features
can be implemented by changing the source code, which, due to being written in
shell, is completely transparent. For instance,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/697a06b1f53f3f8a14e94bd9ccf4de3e">this</a>
patch will have msk_music only run on .mp4 files.</p>

<p>msk_music depends on mpv and a set of coreutils that support sed's "-i" flag.
msk_music is around 20 LOC, and was written in about 10 minutes.</p>
