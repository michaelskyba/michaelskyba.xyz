		<h1>Deltarune Chapter 1 on Linux</h1>

		<p>With the release of Deltarune Chapter 2 today, I thought I would share how
		I was able to get Chapter 1 working on Linux. I will assume you're running Arch.</p>

		<p>1. Download the .exe from <a href="https://deltarune.com/">Deltarune's website</a></p>

		<p>2. Install Wine and libstrangle</p>
<pre>
ssu pacman -S wine
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/libstrangle-git.git
cd libstrangle-git
makepkg -sirc</pre> 
		
		<p class="no-margin">3. Install Deltarune as if you were on Windows using Wine:</p>
		<code>wine SURVEY_PROGRAM_WINDOWS_ENGLISH.exe</code>
		<p>For me, it stopped writing new text after a couple of minutes, at which point I killed it with ^C.
		I guess it finishes installing but doesn't quit Wine?</p>

		<p>4. Run Deltarune using strangle:</p>
<pre>
cd "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/SURVEY_PROGRAM"
strangle 30 wine DELTARUNE.exe</pre>

		<p>That's it, it should work now. Using Wine on its own without libstrangle won't work.
		Feel free to try it if you don't believe me.</p>
