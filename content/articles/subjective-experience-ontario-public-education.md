### Preface

A few weeks ago now, I finished my twelfth year of public education, and
graduated from my high school. At last?

I can still picture myself inside the graduation ceremony. The ceiling fans
did little to quell the heat. The graduation gown the board decided on, sold by
a company whose X account I now see has 8 followers, stuck to my increasingly
sweaty wrists. I tried rotating the position of the sleeve every fifteen
minutes, while wondering how much better at negotiating I'd have needed to be to
escape my parent/guardian's command to attend.

The surrounding seats were filled by students I had never spoken to, and now
hopefully never will. Throughout all of the speeches and presentations, the one
to my left, when not stabbing at the neck of one of his nearby friends in the
next row, scrolled through TikTok on his phone. Another victory for ByteDance's
training data?

In one section of the ceremony, every graduating student had their name called
sequentially. Each student would walk to the stage, receive a counterfeit piece
of paper symbolizing a diploma, pose for a picture, and then walk off to make
room for the next student. It took at least an hour to iterate through
everybody.

At the start of the section, the announcers clarified that we were to hold our
applause until the very end, but people still opted to clap after each name. The
more popular the student, the more cheering you could hear.

When it was finally my turn, my thoughts turned to the correct procedure for
accepting the paper and shaking the principal's hand, and my ears failed to make an
evaluation. My guess is that the magnitude of applause would have been in 20th
percentile or so.

A handful of students would yell out inside jokes or otherwise obscene slogans
into the crowd as they saw their friends being called. I wonder how the parents
felt when the principal spoke her grandiose words of praise, emphasizing how
every student in our school would go on to achieve great things. We, the leaders
of the future, comprised the heart of our strong community! I felt sick.

Who was the target audience of this? Is this really what those anime writers
were trying to capture, when they put graduations into their stories?

A subset of the announced awards were for genuine accomplishments, and I clapped
with respect for the recipients. Still, is this what was motivating them to keep
working? Did they feel fulfilled, as they looked around at the restless faces
and held up their prize?

For the finale of the event, it was time for the students to throw their caps
into the air, as a unitive, sacred tradition!

*...I couldn't force myself to do it.*

### Uh... what?

In this post, I will write about some of my experiences throughout schooling.
Perhaps there's a total of at least three or so people whom could find such
descriptions to be interesting. Mostly, I'm writing this because I expect to
wish to look back on it in the future, and would hope for it to have slightly
more polish than my usual notes.

The focus will be on high school. My memories from elementary school are so
hideous (near-entirely the fruits of my own shortcomings) that I'd prefer to
privately extract the few valuable updates they offered, and toss the rest away.
I only intend to lightly touch on them.

Regardless, these recounts should not be taken as serious evidence for an
assessment of the school board's quality, considering how overflowingly biased I
am going to be on any relevant topic. I would expect many other students to
disagree on anything I paint as supposedly positive or negative.

### _I Am So Proud of This Community_

Let's start with the social environment. You can guess that I'm not exactly
qualified to have a strong opinion on it, but I'll still describe it as
disappointing.

Imagine yourself silently working on your laptop, rubbing your hand across your
hoodie's sleeve because it's somehow always freezing in your P3 classroom.
Suddenly, you hear the distant sound of a
[crash bar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crash_bar) compressing. What do you
expect next?

> Hmm, someone must have entered the central passageway through the Great Hall's
stairwell. They must be returning to class, so I'll hear them gently close the
door and then calmly walk to their appropriate room.

*Ah, what a sweet tale...*

...Yeah, that's not how it goes.

Instead, the first thing you will hear is the sound of the adjacent crash bar,
because the second door is opening, to make room for the stampede of 10 students
who are traveling together.

Huh? What's that new, high-pitched sound? Did the fire alarm turn on (someone
inevitably has the heroic idea of tripping it as a joke every few months)? Nah,
tuned specifically for you, that's an original, deluxe mix of screeching and
cackling, because one kid is lunging at the other as the group pushes each other
through the hallway.

Whoa, something's getting louder? That's the sound of hard, hurried steps,
because they're fully sprinting now. That echo of skidding collision, reminding
you of bent plastic? Ah, that's nothing to worry about. It's just them literally
tugging the garbage bin off of its hook on the wall and whipping it down the
hallway.

(This is around the point where three different teachers would have to interrupt
their lessons to leave their classrooms and try their best to pacify the crowd.)

Fortunately, the worst of them would skip class entirely and have their
"harmless fun" outside, behind some convenience store somewhere. Also
fortunately, this type of student will often opt to take the "Applied" versions
of courses, making it rare for you to have to handle them directly.

###### Representative Accommodation

Downstream are some effects on infrastructure, such as the state of the
washrooms. Even in elementary school I had a policy of avoiding public
washrooms, but high school took it to another level.

If you ever come in, even if only to wash your hands, you'll see a looming
circle of hooded figures, but only barely through the clouds of smoke.

As you reach for the soap, you'll realize someone has already stolen the entire
dispenser off of the wall, and so you have to use the other side, closer to the
group. You distribute the foam as quickly as you can through your fingers,
hoping to avoid the pieces of gum and mysterious red stains inside the sink, and
then scuttle out of the room, before they have a chance to start offering you
anything. After finally escaping, you're left with the sense that your hands are
dirtier now than before you entered...

To the detriment of my physical health, I quickly decided to never bring my
water bottle to school, and thus only consume liquid in the subset of the day
after I return home. In certain cases, I've needed to make exceptions, and so in
total over my entire high school career, I've used the washroom around three
times.

It's common to hear of other students leaving school at lunch, walking all the
way to the [Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Inc.) in the nearby plaza
(~5 min each way), using the public washroom there, and then walking back.

Relatedly, almost every school assembly starts and ends with the vice principal
devising new strategies to deter students from their favourite ritual: showing
up late to class, asking the teacher to use the washroom, and then spending the
rest of the period vaping with their friends around the stalls. It never seems
to work, though; it's still common to see these large groups enter the washroom
together, and thirty minutes later, for an irritated teacher to storm in ("Out!
_Now!_").

My guess is that a large minority (~30%?) of students regularly consumed
recreational drugs. My few ~acquaintances were not the type to be interested, so
I lack solid, empirical evidence on this. Yet I have overheard otherwise
seemingly normal people casually admit to, for example, having smoked cannabis
while skipping their previous class.

One student, after learning that my weekends consisted of programming or doing
other work on my laptop alone in my room, genuinely believed I was lying when I
later clarified that I was not relying on any such drugs to support my
lifestyle.

### The Zoomer Distribution

Fortunately, many reached the threshold of neutrality, but unfortunately, with
very few exceptions, I didn't see students who were actively attempting to
acquire knowledge and ability. It seemed like people's standards only ever
matched, if even, whatever the school, or their parents, directly demanded of
them. The common priority wasn't anything amusing like deliberately shortening
timelines or Death With Dignity, but instead ensuring an invite to the pool
party being planned for next Friday night.

To clarify, I'm not trying to pretend like I'm particularly noble either. I'd
describe my skill level as a merely pitiful "capable of performing a 'web
development' or 'software engineering' role at an average tech company". (Of
course, anybody somewhat capable of learning anything, including me, could be
ramped up into higher roles; it's hard to draw an exact boundary on cache.)
I believe that this, however, is literally the 100th percentile for my school.
Some students clearly exceed me in certain niches and some were close in total
breadth, but the supermajority didn't have any care about progressing in
anything.

I suppose you could argue that seeing people avoiding your goals like the plague
gives you a reference for behaviour _not_ to copy. Although perhaps that could
be beneficial to some, it has only ever felt draining to me. External poor
performance only gives me something to point to as an excuse to slack off.
_Surely I've done enough and deserve a break if I've passed N fraction of the
rest?_ No. I've always been and still am far too slow. Subconsciously, it's a
debilitating
[anchor](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bMkCEZoBNhgRBtzoj/anchoring-and-adjustment),
in this case for normative self-expectations.

I much prefer the kind of environment where I'm only in, perhaps, the 5th
percentile of ~skill. I'd say this is indeed the case for the circle of Xitter
that I frequent, and although much of my time there has certainly been
counterproductive, it is consistently motivating to behold so many people miles
outside of my figurative reach.

![both intellectually and socially, I guess](/1721159677-x.png)
For a long time, I was dead-set on this necessarily being the case in all
possible settings: whenever I would witness any student achieving anything
remotely nontrivial, I would immediately create a long backstory in my head of
how infinitely talented they must be and how much of a living waste of space I
am compared to them. I later came to realize that this isn't an amazing practice
on an epistemic level, but it still obviously has instrumental value in certain
cases.

The staff were usually not too much more impressive. I don't remember meeting a
single teacher since Grade 1 that seemed to actively pursue further study in
whatever subject they were teaching. (In particularly broad cases, you could say
that gym teachers are "exercising" in their spare time, for instance, but it's
not the same.)

However, some at least seemed to like their subject, and on the whole, there was
a nonzero level of personal interest in their students learning and succeeding.

A couple were even willing to invest additional time to support students in
related pursuits outside of class. The CS teacher, for instance, went out of his
way to allocate part of the tech department budget to purchasing Raspberry Pis.
I wrote [some software](https://github.com/a13xrzteach/a13xrzteach.github.io) to
run on them, and we ended up deploying them around the TV monitors, as an
additional display of school information.

(The NVIDIA presentation was a test deployment that I soon after had to remove.
For other tests, I played a few of my Advent of Code and Touhou 10 recordings.)

I've had some other, mostly regrettable social experiences that could be seen as
"interesting", but I won't be able to share them publicly.
