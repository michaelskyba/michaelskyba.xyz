### Preface

A few weeks ago now, I finished my twelfth year of public education, and
graduated from my high school. At last?

I can still picture myself inside the graduation ceremony. The ceiling fans
did little to quell the heat. The graduation gown the board decided on, sold by
a company whose X account I now see has 8 followers, stuck to my increasingly
sweaty wrists. I tried rotating the position of the sleeve every fifteen
minutes, while wondering how much better at negotiating I'd have needed to be to
escape my parent/guardian's command to attend.

The surrounding seats were filled by students I had never spoken to, and now
hopefully never will. Throughout all of the speeches and presentations, the one
to my left, when not stabbing at the neck of one of his nearby friends in the
next row, scrolled through TikTok on his phone. Another victory for ByteDance's
training data?

In one section of the ceremony, every graduating student had their name called
sequentially. Each student would walk to the stage, receive a counterfeit piece
of paper symbolizing a diploma, pose for a picture, and then walk off to make
room for the next student. It took at least an hour to iterate through
everybody.

At the start of the section, the announcers clarified that we were to hold our
applause until the very end, but people still opted to clap after each name. The
more popular the student, the more cheering you could hear.

When it was finally my turn, my thoughts turned to the correct procedure for
accepting the paper and shaking the principal's hand, and my ears failed to make an
evaluation. My guess is that the magnitude of applause would have been in 20th
percentile or so.

A handful of students would yell out inside jokes or otherwise obscene slogans
into the crowd as they saw their friends being called. I wonder how the parents
felt when the principal spoke her grandiose words of praise, emphasizing how
every student in our school would go on to achieve great things. We, the leaders
of the future, comprised the heart of our strong community! I felt sick.

Who was the target audience of this? Is this really what those anime writers
were trying to capture, when they put graduations into their stories?

A subset of the announced awards were for genuine accomplishments, and I clapped
with respect for the recipients. Still, is this what was motivating them to keep
working? Did they feel fulfilled, as they looked around at the restless faces
and held up their prize?

For the finale of the event, it was time for the students to throw their caps
into the air, as a unitive, sacred tradition!

*...I couldn't force myself to do it.*

### Uh... what?

In this post, I will write about some of my experiences throughout schooling.
Perhaps there's a total of at least three or so people whom could find such
descriptions to be interesting. Mostly, I'm writing this because I expect to
wish to look back on it in the future, and would hope for it to have slightly
more polish than my usual notes.

The focus will be on high school. My memories from elementary school are so
hideous (near-entirely the fruits of my own shortcomings) that I'd prefer to
privately extract the few valuable updates they offered, and toss the rest away.
I only intend to lightly touch on them.

Regardless, these recounts should not be taken as serious evidence for an
assessment of the school board's quality, considering how overflowingly biased I
am going to be on any relevant topic. I would expect many other students to
disagree on anything I paint as supposedly positive or negative.
