		<h1>msk_music</h1>
		<p> I have decided to put this "blog" to use for sharing scripts I write, in
		hopes that one or two of them could be of use to somebody.</p>
		
		<h6><a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/2e04107265d4255671bb597581afd76a">msk_music</a></h2>
		
		<p>msk_music is a simple and featureless way of listening to music. It uses the
		equivalent of "random" and "consume" modes on mpd (which it aims to replace). For
		my use cases, which I believe are fairly standard, it does so successfully.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of having a vast number of configuration options, additional features
		can be implemented by changing the source code, which, due to being written in
		shell, is completely transparent. For instance,
		<a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/697a06b1f53f3f8a14e94bd9ccf4de3e">this
		patch</a> will have msk_music only run on .mp4 files.</p>
		
		<p>msk_music depends on mpv and a set of coreutils that support sed's "-i" flag.
		msk_music is around 20 LOC, and was written in about 10 minutes.</p>

		<h1>Get a working Wi-Fi connection in an Artix Installation</h1>
		<p>While Arch and Gentoo have had internet working mostly
		out-of-the-box, Artix has not. I thought it could be beneficial
		if I compiled a list of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Become root: <code>su</code></li>
			<li>
				Create /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with the following lines:
				<br>
<pre>
ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Make sure rfkill isn't messing things up: <code>rfkill unblock wifi</code></li>
			<li>
				Start wpa_supplicant: <code>wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>
				<br>
				My device name was 'wlan0', but you should edit the command if yours is different.
			</li>
			<li>
				Run wpa_cli.
				<br>
<pre>
wpa_cli
scan
scan_results
add_network
set_network 0 ssid "{the name of your wifi network}"
set_network 0 psk "{the password of your wifi network}"
enable_network 0
save_config
quit
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Start dhcpcd: <code>dhcpcd</code></li>
		</ol>
		<p>You should be done. I've done two Artix installs and both of them have
		succeeded with this procedure. Note that for both I have used the base-runit
		installation; it's possible that using a different init system (openrc and s6
		are available currently) will require different steps.</p>

		<h1>Block a site using /etc/hosts</h1>
		<p>Simply add <code>0.0.0.0 mysite</code> to your /etc/hosts file.</p>
		
		
		<p>Example: <code>0.0.0.0 facebook.com</code></p>
		
		<p>Here, facebook.com will basically be an alias for '0.0.0.0', which acts as a dummy address.</p>
