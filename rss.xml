		<h1>Deltarune Chapter 1 on Linux</h1>
		<p>With the release of Deltarune Chapter 2 today, I thought I would share how
		I was able to get Chapter 1 working on Linux. I will assume you're running Arch.</p>
		<p>1. Download the .exe from <a href="https://deltarune.com/">Deltarune's website</a></p>
		<p>2. Install Wine and libstrangle</p>
<pre>
ssu pacman -S wine
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/libstrangle-git.git
cd libstrangle-git
makepkg -sirc</pre> 
		
		<p class="no-margin">3. Install Deltarune as if you were on Windows using Wine:</p>
		<code>wine SURVEY_PROGRAM_WINDOWS_ENGLISH.exe</code>
		<p>For me, it stopped writing new text after a couple of minutes, at which point I killed it with 
C.
		I guess it finishes installing but doesn't quit Wine?</p>
		<p>4. Run Deltarune using strangle:</p>
<pre>
cd "$HOME/.wine/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/SURVEY_PROGRAM"
strangle 30 wine DELTARUNE.exe</pre>
		<p>That's it, it should work now. Using Wine on its own without libstrangle won't work.
		Feel free to try it if you don't believe me.</p>

<title>		Trying out berry</title>
<guid>https://michaelskyba.xyz/blog/3.html</guid>

<description><![CDATA[
		<h1>Trying out berry</h1>
		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>Recently, I found out about <a href="https://github.com/JLErvin/berry">berry</a>,
		which describes itself as "[a] healthy, byte-sized window manager". As of the time I'm writing this,
		I have used berry for around one day. In this post, I would like to share my first impressions.</p>
		<h4>Philosophy</h4>
		<p>The main thing that drew me to berry in the first place is its philosophy.
		<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org">dwm</a>, which I was using before trying berry, does not follow
		the UNIX philosophy as well as I would like. In particular, dwm ships with a statusbar and a hotkey
		daemon (the latter is not a precise description, but I'm not sure what would be a better name;
		if you use dwm, you know what I'm referring to). Neither of these are parts of berry. Additionally,
		berry has no built-in tiling. Instead, you can use berryc to create your own layout.</p>
		<h4>Statusbar</h4>
		<p>If berry doesn't come with its own statusbar, which one did I choose? On dwm, my usage of its
		statusbar consisted of a cron job, running <code>xsetroot -name</code> calls. This was enough for me.
		I didn't need (and still don't need) fancy modules or anything like that.</p>
		<p>With this in mind, I went with the statusbar that berry's website recomended:
		<a href="https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar">lemonbar</a>, which I am quite satisfied with. Lemonbar
		has all of the features I would want in a statusbar without going too far over.</p>
		<p>The main annoyance is that, from what I understand, it is incompatible with fontconfig and
		TTF fonts. After realizing this, I installed
		<a href="https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/lemonbar-xft">lemonbar-xft</a>, a fork with fonts
		working the way I would expect.</p>
		<p>Another thing that caught me a bit off guard was the usage. I assumed you would run <code>bard</code>
		or something similar and then call xsetroot as I was used to. Instead, lemonbar uses standard input.
		For example, you could run <code>echo test | lemonbar -p</code> to set the bar to the word "test".
		Here's what I came up with for replicating my xsetroot workflow:</p>
<pre># Init
rm -f $XDG_DATA_HOME/statusbar
touch $XDG_DATA_HOME/statusbar
tail -f $XDG_DATA_HOME/statusbar | lemonbar -g x25+0+0 -f "Noto Sans JP Medium" -p &</pre>
		<p>Then, inside cron, my battery script runs <code>echo "%{c}$(date)%{c}" >> $XDG_DATA_HOME/statusbar</code>.</p>
		<p>This isn't literally how it works, because I don't just want the date in BusyBox's default format, but you
		get the idea. The <code>%{c}</code>s are used to center the text, which I prefer to dwm's bar, where the placement
		is the right side of the bar. (Yes, I know that there's probably a way to change that, but it's more annoying
		than searching "center" in <code>man lemonbar</code>, especially since dwm's bar additionally shows the title
		of the window and draws workspaces, neither of which I require.)</p>
		<p>Now that I think about it, it's probably easier to simply use <code>killall lemonbar ; echo "%{c}$(date)%{c}" | lemonbar -p</code>.
		I might give that a go later; it will likely perform better over what I just described, the use of a "statusbar" file.</p>
		<h4>berryc</h4>
		<p>Another significant "change" a dwm user would experience is the new reliance on berryc, which is berry's client.</p>
		<p>First, berryc has "settings", which I set in berry's autostart file. I copied the default autostart (from the "examples" directory),
		my main change being that I removed all borders/window decorations.</p>
		<p>Second, and more importantly, berryc gives you control over the management of windows. Instead of setting
		WM-related bindings in a config.h file, you need some kind of hotkey daemon that can map keys to berryc commands.
		I chose to use <a href="https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd">sxhkd</a>, which I would say is one of my favourite
		projects of all time. sxhkd is such a pleasure to use that I even ported my bindings to
		<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fsignal/">fsignal</a> when I was on dwm. As an example,
		<a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/94d2ba318750cc5e5ab5b76d4ffadc6f">here</a> is my current configuration
		for berry. I have a separate, WM-agnostic configuration that includes everything else (e.g. launching my terminal,
		running dmenu scripts).</p>
		<p>Now, seeing this simple config file, combined with the knowledge that berry has no built-in tiling,
		you may be wondering whether managing windows is a huge pain (compared to dwm). My personal answer is no. So far,
		this basic setup of Super+(h|l|Space) for tiling windows is enough, and I've yet to feel a sudden urge to switch back to dwm.</p>
		<p>You should note that I was not a heavy user of "complicated" tiling on dwm. I mostly had a few windows in master-stack
		mode, occasionally popping into monocle mode. My workflow with berry feels just as convenient. If, however, you are frequently
		using something fancy (<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/fibonacci/">this, for example</a>), you will need
		to write a few shell scripts to make berry act the way you like. This should be totally possible, though. See their website
		if you're interested in doing so.</p>
		<h4>Caveats</h4>
		<p>In this section, I will describe a few things that I'm unsatisfied with. I'm pretty much nitpicking,
		though, so none of this should be taken very seriously.</p>
		<p>First, neither resizing nor moving windows using (Super|Alt)+Mouse is working for me. This should
		be taken with a mountain of salt, though, because I'm 99% sure that it's my fault. When I first
		tried berry (with the example configuration), it was working fine. I'll fiddle around with it later.</p>
		<p>Second, I'm not a fan of <a href="https://berrywm.org">their website</a>. Its design does not look simple,
		which, from what I can see, sends the opposite message. Some examples of better-designed websites,
		in my opinion, are (the current states of): my website, KISS Linux's website, and OpenBSD's website.</p>
		<p>Even besides the design, some of the information on the website is inaccurate. For instance, on their
		"Usage" page, they wrote <code>window_*_relative</code> instead of <code>window_*_absolute</code>.
		See the man page if something mentioned on their website isn't working the way you would expect.</p>
		<p>Finally, judging from the GitHub issues, I can see that berry's philosophy is not 100% aligned with mine.
		This is to be expected, of course; different people have different opinions, but still. For an example, see
		<a href="https://github.com/JLErvin/berry/issues/127">this issue</a>. In my eyes, this should be left for the user
		to script, which would not be difficult at all. JLErvin doesn't explicitly agree that it should be added,
		but you get what I mean.</p>
		<h4>Conclusion</h4>
		<p>In conclusion, berry is a great window manager that, in my opinion, follows the UNIX philosophy better than
		dwm does. Unless something overwhelmingly negative and completely unexpected comes up, it is unlikely that I
		will switch back to dwm.</p>
		<p>If you don't care about anything else I have said so far, my only advice would be to try
		berry out for yourself. At <em>worst</em>, you'll lose ~20 minutes of your time and garner newfound respect
		for your current window manager.</p>

<description><![CDATA[
		<h1>msk_music</h1>
		<p> I have decided to put this "blog" to use for sharing scripts I write, in
		hopes that one or two of them could be of use to somebody.</p>
		
		<h6><a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/2e04107265d4255671bb597581afd76a">msk_music</a></h2>
		
		<p>msk_music is a simple and featureless way of listening to music. It uses the
		equivalent of "random" and "consume" modes on mpd (which it aims to replace). For
		my use cases, which I believe are fairly standard, it does so successfully.</p>
		
		<p>Instead of having a vast number of configuration options, additional features
		can be implemented by changing the source code, which, due to being written in
		shell, is completely transparent. For instance,
		<a href="https://gist.github.com/michaelskyba/697a06b1f53f3f8a14e94bd9ccf4de3e">this
		patch</a> will have msk_music only run on .mp4 files.</p>
		
		<p>msk_music depends on mpv and a set of coreutils that support sed's "-i" flag.
		msk_music is around 20 LOC, and was written in about 10 minutes.</p>

<title>		Get a working Wi-Fi connection in an Artix Installation</title>

		<h1>Get a working Wi-Fi connection in an Artix Installation</h1>
		<p>While Arch and Gentoo have had internet working mostly
		out-of-the-box, Artix has not. I thought it could be beneficial
		if I compiled a list of steps:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Become root: <code>su</code></li>
			<li>
				Create /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf with the following lines:
				<br>
<pre>
ctrl_interface=/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Make sure rfkill isn't messing things up: <code>rfkill unblock wifi</code></li>
			<li>
				Start wpa_supplicant: <code>wpa_supplicant -B -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf</code>
				<br>
				My device name was 'wlan0', but you should edit the command if yours is different.
			</li>
			<li>
				Run wpa_cli.
				<br>
<pre>
wpa_cli
scan
scan_results
add_network
set_network 0 ssid "{the name of your wifi network}"
set_network 0 psk "{the password of your wifi network}"
enable_network 0
save_config
quit
</pre>
			</li>
			<li>Start dhcpcd: <code>dhcpcd</code></li>
		</ol>
		<p>You should be done. I've done two Artix installs and both of them have
		succeeded with this procedure. Note that for both I have used the base-runit
		installation; it's possible that using a different init system (openrc and s6
		are available currently) will require different steps.</p>

		<h1>Block a site using /etc/hosts</h1>
		<p>Simply add <code>0.0.0.0 mysite</code> to your /etc/hosts file.</p>
		
		
		<p>Example: <code>0.0.0.0 facebook.com</code></p>
		
		<p>Here, facebook.com will basically be an alias for '0.0.0.0', which acts as a dummy address.</p>
