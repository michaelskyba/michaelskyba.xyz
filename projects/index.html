			<p>PopularInt is a digital platform made with Django about
			integers. You can create an account, vote for integers, and see
			which integers are most popular. There's not that much of a
			"social" aspect to it so there will never be any daily active
			users, but the goal of the project was just to get familiar with
			Django. In that regard, I think it was successful; I now feel
			generally comfortable with the framework's main use cases.</p>

			<p>kvrg-avg is a CLI utility written completely in Python for
			keeping track of central values. For example, you might want
			to keep track of the average duration of your commute, so you
			can more accurately estimate how long it might take. Or, you
			might want to predict the next time you'll see a spider. Both
			of these and many more use cases can be covered with
			kvrg-avg. Making this, I became familiar with command-line
			arguments, reading files/writing to files, and python's modules
			(specifically "datetime").</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/michaelskyba/MathTreadmill">MathTreadmill</a>
			<p>MathTreadmill is a small web application for practicing mental
			arithmetic. It uses JavaScript and Python (Flask). There is an
			"Auto" mode which is sort of like a "campaign" that I created: it
			starts at a trivial level and gets more difficult as you progress.
			It also has a "Custom" mode for making your own exercises. I'm
			currently working on a TUI version because I don't like having to
			run the flask server every time I want to use it, and also because
			I dislike GUIs. From this project, I learned a bunch about
			fundamental web concepts, like routes and requests. This made
			learning Django later (along-side the creation of PopularInt) a
			much smoother experience. Additionally, I now have some experience
			working with SQL.</p>
